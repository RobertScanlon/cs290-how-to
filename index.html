    <h2>Basic API useage</h2>
    <p>
      The 'Deck of Cards' API provides web developers a simple tool for
      creating, displaying, and manipulating a virtual 'deck' of playing cards.

    <h3>Notes On API Use In This Guide</h3>
    <p>
      Many public APIs require the use of an API 'key', a unique identifier
      belonging to a developer. Keys are often used to track and possible limit
      useage of an API according to the agreement bewteen API creator and
      developer. No keys are required to use the 'Deck of Cards' API.
      Therefore, all code examples provided in this tutorial can be copied and
      used 'as is', there is no need to append an API key onto any of the
      requests shown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 'Deck of Cards' API allows requests to be send via either GET or POST
      methods. Since most of the requests require relatively simple data to be
      sent, this guide will show all requests being made via GET.
