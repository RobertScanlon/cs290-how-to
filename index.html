    <h2>Basic API useage</h2>
    <p>
      The 'Deck of Cards' API provides web developers a simple tool for
      creating, displaying, and manipulating a virtual 'deck' of playing cards.
      This guide will provide instruction for use of all the API's features in
      addition to examples of the API im use for some typical applications.
    </p>
    <h3>Notes On API Use In This Guide</h3>
    <p>
      Many public APIs require the use of an API 'key', a unique identifier
      belonging to a developer. Keys are often used to track and possible limit
      useage of an API according to the agreement bewteen API creator and
      developer. No keys are required to use the 'Deck of Cards' API.
      Therefore, all code examples provided in this tutorial can be copied and
      used 'as is', there is no need to append an API key onto any of the
      requests shown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 'Deck of Cards' API allows requests to be send via either GET or POST
      methods. Since most of the requests require relatively simple data to be
      sent, this guide will show all requests being made via GET.
    </p>

    <h2>Requesting A Deck</h2>
    <p>
      For most applications, use of the API is a two step process. First,
      a request is made for a 'deck' of cards. This deck may be a standard 52
      card deck of playing cards, a 'multi-deck' composed of an arbitrary
      number of standard decks, or a custom deck, with only certain cards
      included. Once a request is made, the API will return a 'deck_id'
      string which uniquely identifies the requested deck. The second step is
      then to make further calls to the API passing the deck_id as a
      parameter. This second step will allow for manipulation of the deck,
      including drawing and shuffling cards.
    </p>
    <h3>Example 1: A Fresh Pack of Cards</h3>
    <p class="pCode">
      We now start our API turorial as if we have just bought a new pack of
      playing cards from the store. To simulate this activity on the Web,
      we must set up the following JavaScript function.
      <pre class="jsCode">

// Assume we have an input button with 'id' = "getFreshDeckButton"
// in our page's HTML file

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", bindGetFreshDeck);

function bindGetFreshDeck() {
  document.getElementById("getFreshDeckButton").addEventListener(
    "click", function(event) {
      var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
      var APIurl = "https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/new/";
      request.open("GET", APIurl, true);
      request.send(null);
      request.addEventListener("load", function() {
        if (request.status >= 200 && request.status < 400) {
          var freshDeck = JSON.parse(request.responseText);
          ///////////////////
          // Do Stuff Here //
          ///////////////////
        } else {
          console.log("error");
        }
      });
    event.preventDefault();
  });
}
      </pre>
      <div class="inputButton">
        <input type="submit" name="getFreshDeckButton" value="Run This Code"
               id="ex1Button" />
      </div>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="bodyDivAfterEx">
    <p>
      We will focus our attention on the callback function we nested in
      our 'bindGetFreshDeck' function. Here we create a new 'request'
      object and call its 'open' method passing it three parameters.
      These parameters will be the primary way by which we interact with
      the API. For all examples in this tutorial, the firt parameter 'GET'
      will stay the same. The next paramter, the url string, will be the
      most important as
      it will direct our request to the right location and hold information
      we wish to pass to the API. Our last paramter will
      always be true, as we want all of our requests to be asynchronous.
    </p>
    <p>
      After calling 'open', we call 'send' passing 'null' as an argument, as
      we are sending no additional data. We then add an event listener to our
      request object which will wait until the API's responde is done loading.
      If the repsonse status of our request is OK we can then proceed with
      further processing, which in our case involves creating a JavaScript
      object containing the contents the API's response to our request.
    </p>
    </p>
    <p>
      After running the code above you should see a list of four items and
      their associated values. This data was contained in our example in the
      variable 'freshDeck', which was created by parsing the JSON encoded
      string returned by the API. This technique allows us to easily access
      to different parts of the response using simple object notation.
      For example, to access the 'remaining' property we simple write
      <code>freshDeck.remaining</code>. To our luck, the creator of the API
      uses simple self-explainatory names for these properties. 'Success' tells
      us if what is returned, is what we requested, 'deck_id' is the new deck's
      unique identifier, and I will spare the tediousness of explaining what
      'shuffled' and 'remaining' mean... In the section of code marked by the
      <code>'Do Stuff Here'</code> comment, further processing may be performed
      (such as displaying the object's content, as we did above).
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be noted that the API allows for the creation of a Deck
      containing only certain cards. To do this we use the same code we
      described above but append a <code>'cards'</code> parameter to our URL.
      For example, to create a new deck with only the four Aces we would use
      the following URL.
      <br />
      <code>'https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/new/?cards=AS,AD,AC,AH'</code>
      <br />
      Cards are speficied using a two character code <code>'Rank' + 'Suit'</code>
      . We will see this feature in use in our final example.

    <h2>Drawing From a Deck</h2>
    <p>
      Now creating a new deck of cards was pretty exciting, but also useless if
      thats all we can do. In this section we will learn how to draw cards from
      our deck. Our JavaScript fuction for drawing a card will almost exactly
      the same as our function to create a new deck. The one notable exception
      is that we must alter the url we send to reflect our request.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our first exmaple we used the url
      <code>https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/new/</code>. To draw a card
      we will use the same base url
      <code>https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/</code> but will append three
      elements to its end. The first is the <code>'deck_id'</code>
      of the deck we wish to
      draw from. This is followed by the string <code>'draw'</code> and the
      <code>'count=n'</code>
      parameter where <code>n</code> is some integer representing how many
      cards we wish to
      draw. In this example we will be drawing 1 card from the deck we created
      in the previous example. Note that you must run the first code example
      before attemping to draw a card. Why? Because before running the first
      example we do not have a 'deck' to draw from! After the first example is
      run, the <code>deck_id</code> we receive is saved and used to construct
      the url we need to make a draw request.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click the button below to draw a card from the deck we created earlier
      and see the url that was used to make the request. Note that the
      <code>'deck_id'</code> matches the <code>'deck_id'</code> of the
      deck we created earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="inputButton">
        <input type="submit" value="Draw a Card" id="draw1" />
      </div>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class=bodyDivAfterEx>
    <p>
      We are able to display the card's image by accessing the
      <code>'cards'</code> property of the object we created from our API
      request <code>responseText</code>. This property contains an array of
      the cards we drew from the deck. Because we only drew one card, we
      access our card by with: <code>drawReqResponse.cards[0]</code>.
      To get a url which links to a static image file we then access the
      <code>'images'</code> of our <code>'card'</code> object. Finally, we
      are able to display this image on our webpage by setting this image
      url equal to the <code>'src'</code> property of an HTML
      <code>'img'</code> element as seen below.
    </p>
    <p class="pCode">
      <pre class="jsCode">

        cardImage.src = drawReqResponse.cards[0].image;
      </pre>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class=bodyDiv>
    <h3>To Shuffle Or Not To Shuffle</h3>
    <p>
      If you drew more than a few cards from our deck you may have realized
      that the deck is ordered, with Aces being low and the suits ordered
      Spades, Diamonds, Clubs, Hearts. While this is fine for our example
      most 'real' uses would require a shuffled deck. Fortunately, the API
      provides a method for shuffling an existing deck. Clicking the button
      below will send off the following API request to shuffle the deck
      created in the first example. (Note, if you drew all 52 cards from the
      deck, shuffling will do nothing, refresh the page and start again.) Here,
      <code>'deckId'</code> is a global variable or a parameter which holds
      the <code>'deck_id'</code> of an existing deck.
    </p>
    <p class="pCode">
      <pre class="jsCode">

        var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
        var url = "https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/" + deckId + "/shuffle/";
        request.open("GET", url, true);
        request.send(null);
      </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="inputButton">
        <input type="submit" value="Shuffle Deck" id="shuffleButton" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now go back and draw some more cards using the <code>'Draw a Card'</code>
      button. You should notice the cards remaining in the deck are now
      shuffled.
    </p>
  </div>

    <h2>What Do I Do With My Cards?</h2>
    <p>
      We now know how to create a new deck of cards (either shuffled
      or ordered), and how to draw cards from this deck. However, most card
      games involve tracking and manipulating cards after they are drawn, most
      often as a part of a players 'hand'. The Deck of Cards API provides a
      useful tool to model this behavior, the 'pile'.
    </p>
    <p>
      After drawing a card from a deck, it may be placed in a 'pile' where it
      can then, at a later time, be drawn again. An arbitrary number of piles
      can be created each with a client determined name. This differs from a
      deck whose <code>'deck_id'</code> is determined server side and cannot be
      changed. But wait, this leads to a problem, how does the API know what
      piles belongs to what user?  Surely there would be many piles named
      <code>'player1'</code>, <code>'hand'</code>, etc.
      The solution is that every API call that
      manipulates a pile must also include a valid <code>'deck_id'</code>.
      Just as in a real card game, a 'pile' cannot exist independent of a deck.
      We will look at live example of a pile in use in our next and final
      example, where we play a 'Card Guessing Game'.
